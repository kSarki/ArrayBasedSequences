# Array-Based Sequences - Three Projects

## Overview
This Python project contains three array-based sequence implementations accessible through an interactive menu system:

1. **Infix and Postfix Expressions** - Converts infix mathematical expressions to postfix notation using a stack-based algorithm
2. **Singly Linked List** - Interactive demonstration of linked list operations (append, prepend, delete, display)
3. **Split Evens-Odds** - Separates an array of numbers into even and odd arrays

## Project Structure
- `main.py` - Main program with menu system and all three implementations

## How to Run
Run `python main.py` to start the interactive menu. Select from the four options:
1. Infix and Postfix Expressions
2. Singly Linked List
3. Split Evens-Odds
4. Exit

## Implementation Details

### 1. Infix to Postfix Conversion
- Uses stack-based algorithm with operator precedence
- Supports operators: +, -, *, /, ^
- Handles parentheses for expression grouping

### 2. Singly Linked List
- Custom Node and SinglyLinkedList classes
- Operations: append, prepend, delete, display
- Interactive sub-menu for operations

### 3. Split Evens-Odds
- Separates input numbers into even and odd arrays
- Uses list comprehension for efficient filtering
